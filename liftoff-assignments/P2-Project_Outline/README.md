## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Create an a way to track my Fathers Medication was where this idea came from. My father has a large variety of 
medications.  This is very frustration for my mother to keep track: which ones are current, what the Dr. has changed.
what Dr. prescribes the medication, If they are filled through mail order or picked up when at the facility.
I go on many appointments with my parents, but it gets overwhelming if I am not there.  I hope this is will help keep
a current list of all medications including a list of medications that have been changed and when.
This will make it easier for them to discuss what was changed by other Dr. 

### Features
User login - so it can be used privately by different users
Medications, current and discontinued, keep an ongoing list
which Dr.(either by name or speciality), to be able share with each Dr. what took place on a different appointment

supply  they are usually 1 or 2 month

dose what is the strength. some change often.
